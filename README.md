# CPE 1040 - Introduction to Computer Engineering

## Assignment: Final Project

## Part I (Week 12, Assignment #7)

### 1. Summary

This is the final project and the last required assignment. It contains lab work, source code versioning, and a writeup. The [README.md](README.md) is empty for you to fill with your project writeup. This file, [requirements.md](requirements.md) contains the requirements. There are three parts to the final project, to be done, in order, in weeks 12-14, respectively:
1. An extended version of Assignment #6, requiring some basic I/O and pin operation on the microbit.
2. Oscilloscope exercises and passing data over I2C.
3. Tutorial on creating a Makecode extension package for the soil moisture sensor.
The file [criteria.md](criteria.md) contains the criteria for passing.

# Part 1: Original LEDs
  - the origianl programe in microbit and build the circuit, 
  - using 3 LEDs of different colors. Remember the proper orientation of the LEDs (long leg toward higher voltage). 
  - The original program fades one led to another. Instead of a regular fade, the program waits until an led is fading at half light, then      it starts lighting up the new led.
